This Project developed to implement CSS3 keyframes and animation Skills. I developed animated Solar System with description of planets. I used HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery to implement animated solar system. Main feature of solar system is to Play/Pause animation of solar system and I also implemented day and night simulation on the solar system. The website is made fully responsive using CSS3 media queries.
